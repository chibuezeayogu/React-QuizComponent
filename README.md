# Quiz Application
- This is a Pluralsight Project `Build a Quiz Component with React`. The code can be found [here](https://app.pluralsight.com/projects/build-a-quiz-component-with-react/)
- It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
- Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Technology Stack
- `React`: A JavaScript library for building user interface
- `NodeJS`: An open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- `NPM`: A package manager for Javascrip
- `Babel`: Babel is used to transpile es6 down to es5.
- `Jest`: Jest is a testing platform for client-side JavaScript applications and React applications specifically. 

## For local installation & testing:
- If you don't have NodeJS already installed go [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) and install it.
- Clone this repository by running
- `git clone https://github.com/chibuezeayogu/React-QuizComponent.git` on your terminal.
- Navigate into the cloned project directory.
- For example, if you cloned the project into the desktop directory, then run cd desktop which takes you into the desktop, then `cd React-QuizComponent` to enter the project directory.
- Once in the project directory, install all project dependencies by running `npm install`.
- Run the command `npm start` to start the app in the development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- To run tests, run the command `npm test`.

## Build
-  run the command `npm run build` to builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
